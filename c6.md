Agency, a very [complicated question](https://3ainstitute.cecs.anu.edu.au/)!


This coaster raises more questions than it answers! Some of which might not even be answerable in a general case!

If some liability cases now require courts to adjudicate the humans at fault, will we need to also judge fault of possible non-human agents in future cases?

Does anyone ever have full responsibility or liability for a system?
