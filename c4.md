## Some Hot Ideas

* One thermometer outside gets you the ambient external temperature:
    * Seasons and macro trends
    * Recreate and compare the daily forecast
    * A baseline to anything going on in the building (or to provide a baseline for your second thermometer)

* One thermometer inside and one outside gets you a lot of engineering information about the building
    * What the heating/cooling cycle is and its efficiency
    * How effective the insulation is (both at containing and keeping out heat)

* If you know its just one person in the room, how much body warmth they are generating. This could correlate to some health conditions (cold or fever) or medication side-effects. 

* With two thermometers in a single room and a known number of people could model where they are in relation to the thermometers and triangulate.

* A thermometer on a piece of equipment (and one near by to baseline) indicates how much use the equipment is being put to
    * Anything the runs electricity, moves or emits light loses some of that energy as detectable heat

* A thermometer on a hot water pipe or boiler indicates hot water usage in the building

* A thermometer monitoring the temperature of ice (or anything else with enough data gathered on it) as it melts gives you the pressure of the environment.
    * If your room is at ambient pressure that gives you elevation (if you average it) or weather (if you take the deviation from the average)

* A thermometer inside an artificially cooled or heated space (fridge or oven) tells you when the device is in operation and when it is opened.
    * A thermometer on the heat exchange of an artificially cooled space (where the heat is moved out of the space to the exchange) tells you the efficiency of the device and if it needs maintenance.   

* Placing two thermometers on a metal object and heating one end (and watching the heat dispersion) gives you information about the composition of the metal.  

* A thermometer on your body tracks some health conditions and/or physical exertion.
    * A thermometer on your chest and another on your wrist shows where your body is prioritising blood and warmth.
    Thermometers on your muscles indicate how much energy you exert to complete a task.
