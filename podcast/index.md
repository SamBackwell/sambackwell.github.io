Effective communication can come down to simple timing. Offering the right idea at the exact time someone is most open to it is difficult, unless you let people choose the perfect moment themselves. 

In my reflections preparing for the portfolio I realised that the success of the podcast was at least partially attributable to its strong core analogy. The new podcast strives to draw a similarly strong and useful analogy to engage listeners and test this hypothesis.
